# Tubion
Tubion is a utility mod for the server [TubNet](https://forums.tubnet.gg/). It aims to include highly configurable modifications to the client, to enable you to have a better gameplay experience overall, and to fill in the gaps in TubNet's multiplayer regime.

## Features
Currently, the mod showcases several features:

* Discord Rich Presence - Show your friends what you're up to at TubNet!
* Panorama - Replaces the vanilla rotating background in the title screen to one from New Block City.
* Resource Reloading Screen - Force the resource reloading screen to show the TubNet brand logo and a hue when connecting to TubNet.
* [TubNet Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/tubnet-tweaks) loader - Automatically downloads and injects TubNet Tweaks into the game.
* Better NPC Messages - Prevents NPCs from taking up your whole chat box, and instead sending a message styled like how a player would say!
* Broad Sword Glint - Adds back the enchantment glint from the broad sword, removed in Patch #3
  
    More will be coming soon in the coming weeks, so stay tuned! If you want to contribute any suggestions, [join the discord server](https://dsc.gg/apricotfarmer11)!
## Installing
This mod is only available for Minecraft: Java Edition. If you're on Bedrock Edition, and own Bedrock for Windows, it might be a good idea to [use Java Edition instead](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4607523809933-Buy-Minecraft-PC-Bundle-Get-Both-Games-).

This mod also requires [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), not Forge. Quilt support is planned in the near future.
